# Firstly, what is this website?
This website is an application I designed and developed for an imaginary construction company. The purpose of this website is to serve as a middle man between the company and the potential customer. Giving the customer all the information about the company and their abilities that they might need, while also giving them a reliable method of contact with the company. Since this company is indeed, imaginary, a lot of the functionality does not work such as the Contact form. The goal of this project was to mainly demonstrate my ability to design websites and transfer those designs from the wireframes into a functional website.

## Design Process
I began the design process by creating Low-Fidely wireframes for all of the pages this website needed. These gave me an idea of the layout and content I wanted for each page. I have these low-fidelity wireframes listed below.
